What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I wasn't sure about when or how often to create a new branch. I was also unclear about merging and deleting branches.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I learned that creating and deleting branches is a bit of a personal choice and in a working environment, creating a new branch for each feature would be best.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked questions about differences between git fetch and git pull. I also asked about git branches in general. Had another question about copying the github URL vs. the clone URL.

What still confuses you about Git?

Still a little confused with all of the git commands, but they are starting to make more sense.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My pairing session was abnormal since my pair wasn't able to take part and it was just me and the guide. Thus, I will be able to better answer this after the next GPS.
